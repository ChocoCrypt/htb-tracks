### Chocokrypt.
### Writeup for Heist machine, from HackTheBox (just pwned this machine previusly, i'm just updating the writeups.)

# Discovery:
runing nmap we can see it's a machine with this ports open.\
![portsopen](img/portsopen.png)
![image_2022-07-20-18-30-31](img/image_2022-07-20-18-30-31.png)\
when we go into the page that is open on port 80, we can login as guest and we can see a conversation between a user named "Hazard" and the admin page, in this conversation we can see that they share some files with some hashes.\
the hashes are:
1. $1$pdQG$o8nrSzsGXeaduXrjlvKc91
2. 0242114B0E143F015F5D1E161713
3. 02375012182C1A1D751618034F36415408

So lets crack those hashes with hashcat.
using a tool called "name that hash" i'ts easy to see that:
1. First hash is md5
2. The second hash is a hash Cisco type 7
3. The third hash is a hash is also Cisco Type 7

Using hashcat, we can crack the md5 hash  hash easily. For the otherones we can use this webpage. https://www.firewall.cx/cisco-technical-knowledgebase/cisco-routers/358-cisco-type7-password-crack.html
1. For first hash the password is stealth1agent
2. For second hash the password is $uperP@ssword
3. For third hash the password is Q4)sJu\Y8qz
then we already know that there is a username named Hazard, however, i will use Cewl to collect a list of all the users in the conversation. Then i will use Medusa to crack those hashes. There are other tools like crackmapexec to bruteforce smb service. so we can check that the user is hazard and the password is stealth1agent
